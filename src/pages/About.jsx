      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Full Stack Developer focused on building clean, responsive, and
        user-friendly web applications using React.js for frontend and Java +
        Spring Boot for backend. <br />
        I specialize in creating reusable components, managing state with React
        Hooks, integrating REST APIs, and designing scalable backend services. I
        enjoy solving real-world problems through code, optimizing both frontend
        performance and backend efficiency, and maintaining clean, structured
        code with Git version control. <br />
        I have completed projects like React Portfolio Website, Real-Time
        Weather App, and Smart Expense Tracker, showcasing my ability to handle
        full-stack development, API integration, and responsive UI. <br />
        I am eager to contribute to impactful projects as a Full Stack Developer
        and continuously grow my technical expertise in modern web development.
